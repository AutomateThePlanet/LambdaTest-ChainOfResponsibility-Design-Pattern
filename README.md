:question: **What is this Repository About?**

In automated testing, understanding why tests fail is crucial but can often be time-consuming, especially within complex testing frameworks or when test code lacks clarity. To streamline the diagnosis process, even for those not involved in writing the tests, we adopt the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern. This approach simplifies error handling in tests, akin to try-catch blocks in programming, by sequentially checking for common to less common test failure reasons.

**What Will You Gain?**

- **Streamlined Test Failure Diagnosis:** Understand how the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern can make identifying the reasons behind test failures more straightforward.
- **Targeted Error Checks:** Learn to implement specific checks for common web-related issues, such as JavaScript errors, loading performance, and failed requests, to quickly pinpoint problems.
- **Improved Test Maintenance and Quality:** Discover how this pattern aids in faster test maintenance and elevates the quality of your testing suite through detailed, customized analysis of test failures.

**:key: What is the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern?**

The Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern is a method used to handle a sequence of operations or checks where each check processes a request and decides whether to pass it along to the next handler in the chain. In the context of automated testing, this pattern is applied to systematically diagnose and identify the causes of test failures, starting from the most common issues to the more obscure ones. This hierarchical approach ensures a thorough and efficient troubleshooting process, facilitating quicker fixes and enhancing the robustness of the testing framework.



### Steps to Run Tests Locally in Visual Studio with C#

1. **Open the Project:** Launch Visual Studio and open your C# project.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - **Single Test Method:** Right-click on the test method name > `Run Tests`.
   - **All Tests in a Test Class:** Right-click on the test class file > `Run Tests`.

### Running Tests on LambdaTest

To execute tests on LambdaTest, you need to set up environment variables in your Visual Studio test configurations:

- `LT_USERNAME` with your LambdaTest username.
- `LT_ACCESS_KEY` with your LambdaTest access key.

### Configuring Test Settings in Visual Studio

1. **Access Test Settings:** Navigate to `Test` > `Configure Run Settings` > `Select Solution Wide runsettings File` for broader configurations or use the `Test Explorer` context menu for specific settings.
2. **Set Environment Variables:** In your `.runsettings` file or through the Test Explorer context menu, add your LambdaTest credentials.
   - Include `<EnvironmentVariables>` in your `.runsettings` file with `LT_USERNAME` and `LT_ACCESS_KEY` values.

### Viewing Test Results

Test results are available in the `Test Explorer` window, providing information on passed and failed tests, execution times, and detailed error messages.
